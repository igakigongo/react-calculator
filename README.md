# Calculator

The goal is to design a browser based calculator application for a fictional company `"Maths Magicians"` using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tools and/or technology stack for the project
  - Node.js
  - React
  - ReactDOM
  - Create-React-App
  - NPM
  - CSS
  - ES6
  - Jest

## Getting Started

Clone this repository on your machine.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Features To Add

Calculator input is not reset after the result is evaluated, when a user clicks on a digit it just appends it to the old result. This implies that the user has to clear the screen after each operation, in order to begin performing the next computation/operation. This behavior will be rectified in the next version.
